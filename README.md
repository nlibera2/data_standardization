# Curated list of resources relevant to the standardization of continuous freshwater temperature data and metadata.

This list was identified as one of the products out of the Stream Temperature Data Standardization Working Group co-led by the [Pacific Salmon Foundation](https://psf.ca/), [Pacific DataStream](https://pacificdatastream.ca/), and the [Skeena Knowledge Trust](https://www.skeenatrust.ca/).

Items are organized by general themes of relevance to freshwater data standardization, with efforts being made to list material of direct value to people and organizations collecting, maintaining, and sharing **continuous** **freshwater temperature data**. That said, many, if not most of the material listed also is relevant to other aspects of freshwater monitoring.

This is a living document and is not an exhaustive list. See [here](link) if you have suggestions for resources that could be added. 

Items listed in each subsection are listed alphabetically, and links may appear in multiple subsections if they apply to multiple themes.
