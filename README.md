# Curated list of resources relevant to the standardization of continuous freshwater temperature data and metadata.

This list was identified as one of the products out of the Stream Temperature Data Standardization Working Group co-led by the [Pacific Salmon Foundation](https://psf.ca/), [Pacific DataStream](https://pacificdatastream.ca/), and the [Skeena Knowledge Trust](https://www.skeenatrust.ca/).

Items are organized by general themes of relevance to freshwater data standardization, with efforts being made to list material of direct value to people and organizations collecting, maintaining, and sharing **continuous** **freshwater temperature data**. That said, many, if not most of the material listed also is relevant to other aspects of freshwater monitoring.

## Metadata

## Data collection

-   [Guidance manual for optimizing water quality monitoring program design](https://ccme.ca/en/res/guidancemanualforoptimizingwaterqualitymonitoringprogramdesign_1.0_e.pdf) - book - Manual from the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment that provides an overview of existing approaches for optimizing monitoring program design with a review of the strengths and weaknesses of each as well as recommendations for those most appropriate for use under Canadian conditions and various monitoring requirements.

## Data formating

## Data standards

## Data quality

## Miscellaneous

-   [Freshwater Information Platform](http://www%20freshwaterplatform%20eu/) - website - The Freshwater Information Platform provides up-to-date information on freshwater science as well as an array of research resources and tools for the assessment and management of freshwater ecosystems. The platform's focus is on Europe; its perspective, however, is global.

## Data portals

-   [Pacific DataStream](https://pacificdatastream.ca/) - website - Pacific DataStream is an open access platform for sharing information on freshwater health. It currently allows users to access, visualize, and download full water quality datasets collected by monitoring groups throughout British Columbia and the Yukon
